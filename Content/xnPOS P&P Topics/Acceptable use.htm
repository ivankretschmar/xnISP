        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Purpose</h2>
        <p>End user computing ("EUC") hardware  is the primary gateway to the organisation’s sensitive commercial and customer data and business applications. Implementation of appropriate information security controls for EUC hardware can mitigate the risk to XPS data and IT systems. </p>
        <p>The purpose of this policy is to:</p>
        <p>
            <ul class="FirstLevelLessIndentation">
                <li>To promote the professional, ethical, lawful and productive use of XPS information systems.</li>
                <li>To define and prohibit unacceptable use of XPS information systems.</li>
                <li>To educate users about their information security responsibilities.</li>
                <li>To describe where, when and why monitoring may take place.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Scope</h2>
        <p>This policy applies to all information held in both physical and electronic form. It applies to all locations from which XPS systems are accessed, including home working. It applies to third party suppliers and organisations where they are accessing to XPS information systems. It applies to all systems and business processes.</p>
        <p>This policy applies to anyone who works for XPS, including permanent employees, fixed term employees, agency workers, temporary staff, consultants or contractors and third parties ("Data Users"), that come into contact with information held, generated or distributed by XPS.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Preamble</h2>
        <p>XPS is committed to protecting its commercial interests by ensuring that its information and information processing systems are used in an appropriate manner. Information is an asset and like any other business asset it has a value and must be protected. In order to secure our information, we need to ensure that the systems that we use to store, process and communicate such data are also protected.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.4 ">Controls</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.1 &#160;">General </h3>
        <p>XPS information systems are provided for business use only and XPS will monitor the usage of these systems. As such, you will have no expectation of privacy when using  XPS information systems. For the avoidance of doubt,  XPS reserves the right to monitor any aspect of its information systems in order to protect its lawful business interests and information gathered from such monitoring may be used to instigate or support disciplinary proceedings. Some personal use of XPS information systems (for example the use of email or the Internet) is permitted; however, this must be in line with the guidance provided by this policy.</p>
        <p>This policy refers in several places to things that “others may find offensive”. These include but are not limited to:-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pornographic or sexually explicit material.</li>
            <li>Racist, sexist or homophobic material.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Tasteless material (such as depiction of injury or animal cruelty).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At all times remember that information security is everybody’s’ responsibility and that you must exercise care and common sense in your use of XPS information systems. Roles and responsibilities are defined in XPS Information Security Policy. If you become aware of a security related incident, then you must report it to your line manager or the IT Infrastructure Team.</p>
        <p>You must not use XPS information systems to engage in any illegal activity or indeed any use that contravenes this policy. Nor may you use XPS information systems to engage in any activity that may harm the commercial interest, reputation or business objectives of XPS.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.2 &#160;">Computer Peripherals, Hardware and Devices</h3>
        <p>“Your” computer is the property of XPS and has been prepared by the IT department for use on the XPS corporate network.

        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.4 &#160;">Passwords</h3>
        <p>Strong password access controls are vital in minimising the risk to XPS of its data being accessed by malicious individuals using your computer. As such, the access rights associated with your user account may be changed or revoked should your employment change or be terminated. This change can happen without notice to you, at any point. Authentication for use of technology is defined in XPS Access Control Policy.</p>
        <p>Staff should not write down or share any passwords used for computer systems in use within XPS. Additionally, staff should have a separate password for each system and never re-use a previously used password. Should you ever suspect that your password has been compromised, you should endeavour to change it immediately.</p>
        <p>The use of shared and group user ID’s and/or passwords or other authentication methods, for computer systems in use within XH Hotels is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.5 &#160;">Email</h3>
        <p>XPS email systems and accounts are provided for business use only. However, some reasonable personal use is permitted, provided that it is in accordance with the personal use section of this policy (see section 9). Be aware that XPS monitors all email to ensure compliance with policy. Also remember that email is not a secure method of communication and once a message has been sent that you have no further control over who reads it (for example, never send unprotected card numbers by end-user messaging technologies such as email). Email is admissible in court and carries the same weight as a letter on company headed paper. Authentication for use of technology is defined in XPS Access Control Policy.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.6 &#160;">Internet</h3>
        <p>XPS provides internet access for business use only. However, some reasonable personal use is permitted, provided that it is in accordance with this policy. Be aware that XPS monitors all internet use to ensure compliance with policy. Thus, you must have no expectation of privacy when using the Internet at XPS for business or personal use. Access to certain web sites is blocked in order to protect you and the organisation. This does not imply the suitability of sites that are not blocked. You must always use your discretion along with the guidance below when visiting web sites. Authentication for use of technology is defined in XPS Access Control Policy.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.7 &#160;">Personal Use</h3>
        <p>XPS recognises that personal access to email and the Internet at work helps employees to maintain a positive work life balance. Thus, limited and reasonable personal use of email and the Internet is permitted. Personal use of all other systems is prohibited. If you choose to make personal use of XPS systems then you must accept that this use will be monitored. As personal use of email and the Internet is a privilege, XPS reserves the right to withdraw it either individually or globally at any time without notice or explanation.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.7.0.1 ">Your personal use of email and the Internet must:-</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">

        <p>You are personally responsible for ensuring that your use of XPS information systems is lawful.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.8.0.1 ">You must:-</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Comply with software licences, copyrights and all other laws governing intellectual property.</li>
            <li>Comply with relevant local regulation and statutory requirements for the country location of where you work. For example, if you are based in the United Kingdom, then you must perform your job function in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</li>

        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.9 &#160;">Monitoring</h3>
        <p>XPS owns the company’s information systems and any information that resides on them. It reserves the right to monitor any company system at any time. Monitoring of systems is carried out in order to:-</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Detect and prevent unlawful use of systems.</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent misuse of company systems – including excessive personal use.</li>
            <li>Maintain the effective operation of systems.</li>
            <li>Protect the reputation of XPS.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>You must have no expectation of privacy when using XPS information systems, whether for business or personal use. Raw monitoring data will be viewed and analysed by the IT Infrastructure Team and the data may be passed as necessary to any of the following:-</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>The Human Resources Department.</li>
            <li>The appropriate line manager.</li>
            <li>The police.</li>
            <li>Any other agency that has legal grounds to request the data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.10 &#160;">Printing</h3>
        <p>Printers are provided for business use only. When printing a document you must consider that colour printers cost much more per page than black and white ones - even if there is no colour on the page. Your department is responsible for consumables of your printer, these include but are not limited to toner, ink cartridges, paper and fusers. If it is discovered that a printer has been physically abused and as a result is broken, the department will bear the cost of repair or replacement of the unit.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.10.0.1 ">Required actions</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Be selective about what you print - print only when necessary and only the necessary pages of a document.</li>
            <li>Print duplex (double sided) to save paper where possible.</li>
            <li>Use a photocopier when producing a large number of copies.</li>
            <li>Keep the area around printers tidy</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.10.0.2 ">Prohibited actions</h4>

            <li>Leave copies of sensitive information unattended on the printer.</li>
            <li>Print to a colour printer unless colour conveys important information in your document that would be lost in black and white.</li>
            <li>Resend your print job if nothing happens. Instead, check the following:-<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>Is the print job still listed in the queue?</li><li>Did you send it to the right printer?</li><li>Is the printer switched on?</li><li>Is the printer in an error state because there is paper jam, it is out of paper or it is out of toner / ink?</li></ol></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.4.11 &#160;">13	Use of Resources</h3>
        <p>Implementing the small changes described in this section can make a big difference to the organisation’s costs, and also to the environment. For example, phone chargers and AC adapters consume a small amount of power even when nothing is connected to them.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.11.0.1 ">Required actions</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Shut your computer down at the end of your working day rather than just logging off. The energy saved over a year is enough to boil 60 tonnes of water.</li>
            <li>Turn off your monitor before you leave rather than leaving it in standby.</li>
            <li>Unplug or switch off Smartphone chargers when they are not in use.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4.11.0.2 ">Prohibited actions</h4>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Turn off computer equipment on behalf of someone else. There may be a good reason why it has been left on.</li>
            <li>Do not turn off fax machines.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.5 ">Control exceptions</h2>
        <p>All exemption requests must be reviewed, assessed and approved by the relevant business stakeholders</p>
        <p>The table below maps this Policy with the security domains of the ISO27001:2013 Security Standard.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.6 ">Policy enforcement</h2>
        <p>Violation of this policy may result in the termination of access and/or disciplinary action which may include termination for XPS employees, contractors and third party contracts and may result in further legal or criminal action</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.7 ">Poicy review, approval and history</h2>
        <p>This section details the initial review, approval and ongoing revision history of this Policy. A review of this Policy will be managed by the Responsible Officer on an annual basis.</p>
