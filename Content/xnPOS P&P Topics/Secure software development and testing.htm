        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that the risk of security vulnerabilities being introduced into XPS production environments is minimised.</p>
        <p>As part of the XPS Systems (“XPS”) commitment to the security of its clients’ data, XPS has implemented this Policy to ensure that all software that is developed by XPS is developed (coded) in line with industry best practice and tested for security vulnerabilities. This is in order to ensure that vulnerabilities are not inadvertently or maliciously introduced into XPS live production environment – which could potentially lead to XPS data being compromised. This Policy contains the minimum requirement for the development and testing of software deployed on XPS systems.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Scope</h2>
        <p>This Policy applies to anyone who works for XPS, including permanent employees, fixed term employees, agency workers, temporary staff, consultants or contractors and  parties (also known as Data Users), that have any involvement (development, coding or testing) with  code that is deployed within XPS hosted application environments.</p>
        <p colspan="4">The scope of this Policy is limited to the deployment of code that is to be deployed on systems that are located within XPS hosted application environments.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Controls</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.1 &#160;">General</h3>
        <p>All of XPS  software development is developed in-house. Thus, XPS requires a full Software Development Life Cycle ("SDLC"), and must ensure that its internal development team codes in line with industry best practice and incorporate information security throughout the SDLC, where that software is to be deployed within XPS hosted application environments.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>All  code and software that is to be deployed into XPS hosted application environments must be developed in-house.</li>
            <li>All application developers that add OR make changes to code within XPS, must be trained in THE following secure coding techniques:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>Injection flaws.</li><li>Buffer overflows.</li><li>Insecure cryptographic storage.</li><li>Insecure communications.</li><li>Improper error handling.</li><li>All high risk vulnerabilities identified by the XPS risk management process.</li></ol><p>This development procedure must be formally communicated to all staff that develop code and software that is to be deployed into XPS hosted application environments.</p></li>
            <li>The communication of this procedure is the responsibility of the Lead Application Development Manager, who must ensure that this is undertaken prior to employment, on an annual basis and after any change to this procedure.</li>
            <li>Employees must formally accept and acknowledge that they will develop software, maintain coding standards and perform testing in accordance with this procedure.</li>
            <li>XPS must follow the process described in this document that details how all  code deployed into the hosted application environment will be tested for security vulnerabilities before accepting it from an  application developer.</li>
            <li>This procedure only applies to  code that will be deployed within XPS hosted application environments and from this point forward all statements only apply to that scope.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.2 &#160;">Software development and testing</h3>
        <p>XPS recognises that its internal applications team develops code on its behalf and has a SDLC which includes information security throughout the life cycle. XPS also recognises and tries to be prescriptive as to which industry best practices are used, and realises that additional complexities to the development process maybe incurred. </p>
        <p>XPS also requires reassurance that the  code that it deploys on its systems is developed and tested in line with industry best practice, including Information Security throughout the life cycle, to reduce the risk of code being deployed on those systems that contains security vulnerabilities. Thus, each application Developer must formally accept and acknowledge that its respective SDLC meets the requirements defined in this section and the Develop  can provide evidence demonstrating compliance with these requirements. This evidence in turn, will be used by XPS for auditing purposes.</p>
        <p>Requirements</p>
        <p>All software maintenance and development must be based on industry best practices and fully documented in a SDLC. The SDLC must:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Define how information security is included and considered throughout the software development process.</li><li>State which industry best practices are followed.</li><li>Define how applications are developed in accordance with PCI DSS.</li><li>State that all software changes or the reconfiguration of software must be fully tested prior to release into the XPS live environment.</li><li>State that any test or development environment that is to be released into the XPS live environment, must have all  data and test accounts removed prior to release and that it is not permitted to have  data or  accounts in the XPS release. This includes  application accounts, usernames or passwords.</li><li>State that there must be a peer review of  code developed on behalf of XPS before it is released to XPS. Manual and / or automated code review processes are used as defined within the Change Control Policy.</li><li>State that the  code review process:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>covers all application code changes;</li><li>requires that the code is reviewed by persons different to the original author;</li><li>requires that the code is reviewed by persons who are knowledgeable in code review techniques;</li><li>requires that the code is reviewed by persons who are knowledgeable in secure coding practices;</li><li>ensures that the secure coding guidelines defined in the SDLC are followed.</li><li>ensures any code corrections identified must be rectified prior to release to the XPS live environment; and</li><li>ensures that code review results are reviewed and approved by management prior to release.</li></ol></li></ol></p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>State that there must be separate development and testing environments with access control in place to enforce the separation, and separation of duties must be enforced to ensure no single individual has access to both environments.</li>
            <li>State that the development and test environments must be segmented using either routers with stringent access control lists or firewalls with stringent access control lists.</li>
            <li>State that separation of duties between test and development environments must be strictly enforced.</li>
            <li>State that user access lists to test and development must be maintained.</li>
            <li>State that it is prohibited to use genuine payment card data in any development or test environment and that test card data shall be used for such purposes.</li>
            <li>Define the test data removal procedure that ensures that any test or development environment that is released to XPS must have all test data and test accounts removed prior to deployment.</li>
            <li>State that it is not permitted to have test data or test accounts in the environment to be release to XPS - this includes test application accounts, usernames or passwords.</li>
            <li>Define the specific code conventions and styles used for software development.</li>
            <li>State that all code will be commented as it is written and that software developers are responsible for creating the program documentation.</li>
            <li>Define how all web applications developed by XPS, must follow industry accepted secure coding guidelines. All web applications within the scope of PCI DSS whether internal or external are covered by this requirement.</li>
            <li>Define how the selected secure coding guidelines for the development of all web applications within the scope of PCI DSS must be followed.</li>
            <li>Describe how all application developers must be trained on the selected secure coding guidelines.</li>
            <li>State that a documented web application development process must be used and that all web-facing developed code must be reviewed in order to remove any vulnerability as outlined in the OWASP Top Ten (<a href="http://www.owasp.org/">www.owasp.org</a>). This document must define the processes for identifying the following vulnerabilities:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>Injection flaws (including SQL injection).</li><li>Buffer overflows.</li><li>Insecure cryptographic storage.</li><li>Insecure communications.</li><li>Information leakage and improper error handling.</li><li>Cross-site scripting (XSS).</li><li>Improper access control.</li><li>Cross-site request forgery.</li><li>Input validation.</li><li>Session fixation.</li><li>Insecure direct object references.</li><li>Remote file inclusion.</li><li>PHP security.</li></ol><p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The OWASP top ten change periodically and must be updated as and when they change.</p></li>
            <li>Define how the web application development process will ensure that web applications are not vulnerable to ‘high’ risk vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>State that all web-facing application code must be reviewed for common vulnerabilities via manual or automated application vulnerability security assessment tool prior to release to the XPS live environment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.3 &#160;">Code management procedure</h3>
        <p>XPS uses in-house software developers to develop its code, and is clear to these employees that it requires that code is developed using an SDLC. Thus, strong management of those code reviews is required in order that code is delivered that meets the agreed standard. This must include appropriate tests to ensure that none of the security vulnerabilities that the developers’ SDLC seeks to eliminate are present in the code that is to be placed into the live environment.</p>
