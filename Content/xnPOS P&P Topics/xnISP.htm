        <h2 class="missionDocument">Overview</h2>
        <p>Xn protel Systems ("XPS") helps world-class hospitality companies in over 50 countries  optimise revenue generation, simplify service operations and enhance the quality of guest communications.</p>
        <p>XPS and its employees have an inherent responsibility to protect the physical information assets of the company as well as confidential customer data and intellectual capital owned by the company.  These critical assets must be safeguarded to mitigate any potential impacts to XPS and its customers.  Information Security is a critical business function that shall be incorporated into all aspects of XPS business practices and operations. </p>
        <p> 
To achieve this end, policies, procedures, and standards have been created to  identify, mitigate, monitor and manage information security vulnerabilities, threats and risks in order to protect XPS and its assets, information and data.</p>
        <p>This document describes the XPS Information Security Program ("xnISP" or "the Program") and establishes the intent, direction and principles for the protection of XPS <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term41">IT assets</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. This is to enable continuous improvement of XPS security capability and resilience to emerging and evolving Information Security threats.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Information Security definition</b>
        </h3>
        <p>XPS has adopted the following definition from the US National Information Systems Security glossary; Information Security is:</p>
        <p><i>“The protection of information systems against unauthorised access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing or transit, and against the denial of service to authorised users or the provision of service to unauthorised users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.”</i>
        </p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Program objectives</b>
        </h3>
        <p>The xnISP focuses on three objectives for the protection of commercial and customer information: </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">
                <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term6">Confidentiality</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
            </li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">
                <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term7">Integrity</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
            </li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">
                <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term8">Availability</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This document provides stakeholders with the overarching approach to the management of XPS Information Security in general and forms the master policy document for this Program. All embodied policy documents shall be consistent with the information communicated in this document and  support the these three primary objectives.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>The need information security</b>
        </h3>
        <p>XPS requires Information Security to protect <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term4">information assets</MadCap:glossaryTerm> from security threats.  It is critical to protect the system environment to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, to ensure profitability, and to secure and maintain member and partner trust and confidence.</p>
        <p>Threats originate from a wide variety of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, corporate espionage, sabotage, vandalism and natural disasters.  Computer viruses, unethical hacking and denial of service attacks are examples of threats encountered while operating over the Internet.  These types of threats continue to advance in frequency, ambition and sophistication.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Program intent and direction</b>
        </h3>
        <p> Three mutually compatible tenets provide the intent and direction:
</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Security is everyone’s responsibility.  An effective and efficient stance on security relies on a proactive stance on security from everyone.  Security is not “somebody else’s problem;” Permanent employees, fixed-term and agency workers, temporary staff, consultants, contractors and other third parties should all shoulder  the responsibility and adhere to XPS security-related policy and procedure.</li>
            <li> Information Security does not focus on physical and technical “border control" alone;  XPS seeks to ensure reasonable and appropriate levels of security awareness and protection throughout the organisation and its IT&#160;infrastructure. </li>
            <li> Information Security is a business enabler:  a strong security foundation becomes an effective market differentiator for XPS.  Security has a direct impact on the company's viability in a competative marketplace and it should itself be treated as a valued product.
</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These tenets are also mutually supportive: ignoring any one in favour of another will undermine XPS'  overall stance on Information Security.
</p>
        <h2 class="missionDocument">Mission statement</h2>
        <p>XPS is committed to preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all key information assets in order to maintain its competitive edge, legal and contractual compliance and reputation. The xnISP (comprising this document and all embodied policy and procedure) shall be the enabling mechanism for reducing information-related risk to an acceptable level.</p>
        <h2 class="missionDocument">Framework</h2>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Policy documentation</b>
        </h3>
        <p>XPS Executive Management will provide direction for, approve, publish and communicate the merits of Information Security policy documentation. Policy  documentation details Management's approach to Information Security and provides the organisation with a strong indication of Management’s commitment to the same.</p>
        <p>The purpose of policy documentation is to communicate the direction of the Program by providing relevant, accessible and understandable definitions, statements and explanations.</p>
        <p>xnISP policy documentation shall:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Define Information Security and its scope and importance at XPS.</li>
            <li>Provide a statement of management’s intent withrespect to Information Security.</li>
            <li>Explain the XPS security policies, controls and compliance requirements, including:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Compliance with legislative and contractual requirements</li><li>Commitment to security education and awareness</li><li>Consequences for policy violations</li><li>Preventative measures against viruses and other malicious software attacks.</li><li>Commitment to effective business continuity management</li></ol></li>
            <li>Describe specific responsibilities concerning Information Security and its management.</li>
            <li>Outline policy and procedure for reporting security incidents.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Documentation conventions</b>
        </h3>
        <p>The following is a list of conventions used in this and all related policy documentation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of the word <b>shall</b> will indicate a mandatory requirement.</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>should</b> will indicate a requirement for good practice (implemented wherever possible).</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>may</b> will indicate a desirable requirement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="missionDocument">Data confidentiality</h2>
        <p>XPS&#160;has a duty of care to its customers and will  ensure that all service providers and third parties who are granted need-to-know access to sensitive commercial and customer data will be bound by the polcies and procedures defined under this Program.</p>
        <h2 class="missionDocument"> Policy statements</h2>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Acceptable use</b>
        </h3>
        <p>This Policy and its associated controls outline the acceptable practices in the use of technology and access to information sources and systems for XPS system users.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> All users who have access to XPS IT systems and services must adhere to specific rules regarding use of XPS resources, their internet and email usage as well as when interacting with social media. See <MadCap:xref href="Acceptable use.htm">" Acceptable use policy" on page&#160;1.</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>User access control </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Preventive measures to ensure only authorised users are granted access to XPS systems. Unauthorised access could enable a malicious or accidental security breach. Breach of access could lead to unwanted release or manipulation (integrity) of sensitive information potentially resulting in loss of productivity, reputation or business value.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> All user access related requests (e.g. adding new users, updating access privileges, and revoking user access rights) must be logged, assessed and approved in accordance with defined user access control process. See <MadCap:xref href="Access control.htm">" Access control policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Data backup </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Data backup is  a preventative measure taken to protect against data loss resulting from system failures (disaster or other), virus or malware attack, system or human error. It is an essential control and safeguard to ensure the availability of stored, processed or transmitted information.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Data must be backed-up on a regular basis, protected from unauthorised access or modification during storage, and available to be recovered in a timely manner in the event of incident or disaster. See <MadCap:xref href="Data backup.htm">"Data backup" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>IT&#160;recovery</b>
        </h3>
        <p>Service availability is critical for IT-related communications, infrastructure, systems and applications. This Policy ensures that processes are in place to ensure XPS' ability to recover from system and environmental failures, and that these processes are tested on a regular basis.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> An IT recovery plan and relative process must be in place to enable the recovery of business critical services in a timely manner, to minimise the effect of IT disruptions and to maintain resilience before, during, and after a disruption. See <MadCap:xref href="IT recovery.htm">"IT recovery policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Change control </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Change control  ensures the stability and availability of all interrelated <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term42">ICT</MadCap:glossaryTerm> systems. Secure practices including reviews during changes are necessary to ensure service availability.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Any change to XPS production information systems must be logged and assessed for security and risk impact as documented in the XPS Change Control process. The requirements, risk and impact of each request must be evaluated and the proposed risk mitigation solution must be documented and approved. See <MadCap:xref href="Change control.htm">"Change control policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>IT asset management</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></h3>
        <p>Asset management is vital to prudent security and management practices; it is key to the ongoing management of security vulnerabilities.&#160;In-scope devices are readily identified, assessed and patched. Out-of-scope devices can be missed, remaining unpatched and exposed to malicuous exploit. </p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> An IT asset is any XPS owned or managed device or service that connects to or is used by XPS to conduct its business. This includes any data link, physical device, database and other middleware. See <MadCap:xref href="IT asset management.htm">"IT&#160;asset management policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Encryption </b>
        </h3>
        <p>XPS supports an extensively broad and complex data landscape. Based on appropriate data classification and handling guidelines, this policy and associated standard ensures that appropriate controls are implemented for the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Encryption techniques must be used for protecting sensitive data during transmission and storage. </p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Incident response</b>
        </h3>
        <p>Provides preventive, corrective and detective measures, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to the management of information security incidents, including communication of events and weaknesses, such as breach of access. Well designed, understood tools and processes will help contain, preserve (for legal and forensic purposes) and limit any damage resulting from a security incident.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Incident detection mechanisms such as security event logging and antivirus must be implemented for all IT systems. All potential security incidents must be handled appropriately following a formalised security incident handling process. See <MadCap:xref href="Incident response policy.htm">"Incident response policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Information risk and compliance management </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Risk Management is at the core of the Information Security Program. Allowing XPS to identify, assess and evaluate risk, enabling, effective management of information security vulnerabilities and threats to its information assets that could adversely affect or provide academic and business opportunities.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Information Security risk must be identified, mitigated and monitored through a formalised risk management process. Compliance with the Information Security Program must be measured and monitored to ensure compliance. </p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Logging and monitoring </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection&#160;(IDS) and prevention&#160;(IPS), security event incident management, mail content filters and anti-virus all generate log data. The timely detection of information security incidents relies on comprehensive security log data being available from information technology communication systems.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Key security-related events such as user privilege changes must be recorded in logs, protected against unauthorised changes and analysed on a regular basis in order to identify potential unauthorised activities and facilitate appropriate follow up action. </p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Network security </b>
        </h3>
        <p>Network infrastructure and associated data links provide essential connectivity between internal and external systems. In order to provide mitigation against malicious activity, secure boundaries and connections need to be defined and managed in line with current security practises.</p>
        <p class="Example">Statement: XPS network architecture must be commensurate with current and future business requirements and factor in any emerging security threats. Appropriate controls must be established to ensure security of XPS data in private and public networks, and the protection of IT services from unauthorised access. See <MadCap:xref href="Network security.htm">"Network security policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 class="missionDocument"><b>Software security</b>
        </h3>
        <p>Applications, databases and middleware services ("IT&#160;Systems") are susceptible to attack and therefore security controls must be embedded throughout the whole acquisition and development lifecycle. In conjunction with this and other controls, a multi-level approach to information security at each layer of the system must be taken, therefore mitigating the security risk.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> IT security requirements must be addressed within the software development lifecycle, to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced during the acquisition or development of IT systems. See <MadCap:xref href="Secure software development and testing.htm">"Secure software development and testing policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
