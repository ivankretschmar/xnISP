        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Overview</h2>
        <p>Xn protel Systems ("XPS") helps world-class hospitality companies in over 50 countries  optimise revenue generation, simplify service operations and enhance the quality of guest communications.</p>
        <p>XPS and its employees have an inherent responsibility to protect the physical information assets of the company as well as confidential customer data and intellectual capital owned by the company.  These critical assets must be safeguarded to mitigate any potential impacts to XPS and its customers.  Information security is a critical business function that should be incorporated into all aspects of XPS business practices and operations. </p>
        <p> 
To achieve this end, policies, procedures, and standards have been created under a common Information Technology Security Framework ("ITSF") to pro-actively and actively identify, mitigate, monitor and manage information security vulnerabilities, threats and risks in order to protect XPS and its assets, information and data.</p>
        <p>The ITSF sets the intent and establishes the direction and principles for the protection of XPS IT assets. This is to enable continuous improvement of XPS security capability and resilience to emerging and evolving security threats.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.1.1 &#160;">Information security definition</h3>
        <p>XPS has adopted the following definition from the US National Information Systems Security glossary; Information Security is:</p>
        <p><i>“The protection of information systems against unauthorised access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing or transit, and against the denial of service to authorised users or the provision of service to unauthorised users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.”</i>
        </p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.1.2 &#160;">Objectives</h3>
        <p>The ITSF and its related policies focus on three objectives for protecting commercial and customer information: </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Confidentiality</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Integrity</li>
            <li style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">Availability</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This document provides the overarching approach to the management of XPS IT security in general and forms the <b>master policy document</b>. All related policy documents shall be consistent with the information communicated in this document and  support the three objectives.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.1.3 &#160;">The need information security</h3>
        <p>XPS requires information security to protect <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="ISP Glossary.Term4">information assets</MadCap:glossaryTerm> from security threats.  It is critical to protect the system environment to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, to ensure profitability, and to secure and maintain member and partner trust and confidence.</p>
        <p>Security threats originate at a wide variety of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, industrial espionage, sabotage, vandalism and natural disasters.  Computer viruses, unethical hacking and denial of service attacks are examples of threats encountered while operating over the Internet.  These types of threats are becoming increasingly more common, more ambitious and more sophisticated.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.1.4 &#160;">Intent and direction</h3>
        <p> Three mutually compatible tenets provide the intent and direction for the ITSF:
</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Security is everyone’s responsibility.  Maintaining an effective and efficient security posture for XPS requires a proactive stance on security issues from everyone.  Security is not “somebody else’s problem;” as a member of XPS, you have the responsibility to adhere to the security policies and procedures of the company and to take issue with those who are not doing the same.
</li>
            <li> Security permeates the XPS organisation.  Security is not just focused on physical and technical “border control.” Rather, XPS seeks to ensure reasonable and appropriate levels of security awareness and protection throughout our organisation and infrastructure.  There is no place in the business where security is not a consideration.
</li>
            <li> Security is a business enabler.  A strong security foundation, pro-actively enabled and maintained, becomes an effective market differentiator for our company.  Security has a direct impact on our viability within the marketplace, and must be treated as a valued commodity.
The tenets of our philosophy of protection are mutually supportive; ignoring any one tenet in favor of another undermines the overall security posture of our organisation.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Mission statement</h2>
        <p>XPS is committed to preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all key information assets in order to maintain its competitive edge, legal and contractual compliance and reputation. The ITSF (comprising this document and all related policies and procedures) shall be the enabling mechanism for reducing information-related risk to acceptable levels.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Security framework</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.1 &#160;">Policy documentation</h3>
        <p>XPS Executive Management will provide direction for, approve, publish and communicate the merits of information security policy documentation. Policy  documentation details Management's approach to information security and provides the organisation with a strong indication of Management’s commitment to information security.</p>
        <p>The purpose of information security policy documentation is to communicate the direction of the ITSF by providing relevant, accessible and understandable definitions, statements and explanations.</p>
        <p>ITSF policy documentation shall:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>Define information security as well as its scope and importance in XPS;</li>
            <li>Include a statement of management’s intent for information security;</li>
            <li>Explain the organisation’s security policies,controls and compliance requirements, including:<ul><li>Compliance with legislative and contractual requirements.</li><li>Security education and awareness commitment.</li><li>Consequences for information security violations.</li><li>Prevention and protection against viruses and other malicious software attacks.</li><li>Commitment to well thought-out and effective business continuity management.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Outline specific responsibilities for information security management.</li>
            <li>Outline policies and procedures for reporting security incidents.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.2 &#160;">Documentation conventions</h3>
        <p>The following is a list of conventions used in this and all related policy documentation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of the word <b>shall</b> indicates a mandatory requirement.</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>should</b> indicates a requirement for good practice, which should be implemented whenever possible.</li>
            <li>Use of the word <b>may</b> indicates a desirable requirement.</li>

            <li>Any changes to network configuration or new applications are included in XPS security policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A formal documented risk assessment process should also be completed annually to identify key business assets (including credit card data stores and supporting networks), and potential threats and vulnerabilities which could impact on the security of those assets.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.5 &#160;">Policy breaches </h3>
        <p>Company disciplinary procedures will be invoked in the case of staff or third parties breaching the Policy Statement and /or any supporting policies or controls.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.3.6 &#160;">Policy communication and training</h3>
        <p>The XPS Technical Services Department has overall responsibility for the creation and distribution of all information security-related policies and procedures. These documents are presented to all staff when joining the company and are available on the company intranet. Contractors and third-party companies who may have access to sensitive commercial or customer data are emailed the document and asked to reply to this email to acknowledge receipt. All staff are reminded that the documents are sensitive and should not be removed from XPS buildings/offices.</p>
        <p>Changes to, removal of, or the introduction of policies are circulated to relevant parties   one (1) day in advance to allow time for them to adapt to changes. XPS does however reserve the right to modify policy immediately and without notice.</p>
        <p>Staff are kept aware of policies via the following methods of communication:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Staff meetings.</li>
            <li>Emails, Intranet or Staff Bulletins.</li>
            <li>Data security awareness training, including authentication procedures and policies, is to be conducted for new starters during induction, and for all staff, at least annually to make all personnel aware of the importance of  data security.  XPS shall also ensure that vendors, contractors, and business partners covered by this policy are familiar with its requirements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once a new policy has been introduced, following significant changes, and at least annually, all staff must endorse the IT security policies. This ensures that they have read and understood the policy (or changes) and accept any consequences should they fail to adhere to them.</p>
        <p>Users will be made familiar with XPS&#160;Access Control and Acceptable Use policy and procedure  and will be offered specialist training if required.</p>
        <p class="note3"><b>Employees with privileded data access:</b> Any XPS&#160;employee granted need-to-know access to sensitive commerial or customer data, shall be given extra training to ensure they are aware of the significance of the data being held and the repercussions of disclosing it to those who have not been granted access.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.4 ">Hiring policy</h2>
        <p>XPS shall ensure that all new employees shall be subjected to previous employment history checks and shall provided current references from previous employers. All information gathered for employment checks shall be maintained in the employee’s personnel file.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.5 ">Data confidentiality</h2>
        <p>XPS&#160;has a duty of care to its customers and will  ensure that all Service Providers and Third Parties who are granted need-to-know access to sensitive commercial and customer data wiill be bound by the polcies and procedures defined under this Framework.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.6 ">ITSF policy statements</h2>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.1 &#160;">User access control policy</h3>
        <p>Preventive measures to ensure only authorised users are granted access to XPS systems. Unauthorised access could enable a malicious or accidental security breach. Breach of access could lead to unwanted release or manipulation (integrity) of sensitive information potentially resulting in productivity, reputational or financial loss.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> All user access related requests (e.g. adding new users, updating access privileges, and revoking user access rights) must be logged, assessed and approved in accordance with defined user access control process. See <MadCap:xref href="Access control.htm">" Access control policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.2 &#160;">Acceptable use policy</h3>
        <p>This Policy and its associated controls outline the acceptable practices in the use of technology and access to information sources and systems for XPS system users.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> All users who have access toXPS IT systems and services must adhere to specific rules regarding use of XPS resources, their internet and email usage as well as when interacting with social media. See <MadCap:xref href="Acceptable use.htm">" Acceptable use policy" on page&#160;1.</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.3 &#160;">IT&#160;recovery policy</h3>
        <p>Service availability is critical forXPS IT communications, infrastructure, systems and applications. This Policy ensures that processes are in place to ensure XPS' ability to recover from system and environmental failures, and regular testing of these processes is afforded.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> An IT Recovery Plan and relative process must be in place to enable the recovery of business critical services in a timely manner, to minimise the effect of IT disruptions and to maintain resilience before, during, and after a disruption. See <MadCap:xref href="IT recovery.htm">"IT recovery policy" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.4 &#160;">Data backup policy</h3>
        <p>Data backups are primarily a preventative measure to protect against loss of data resulting from system failure (disaster or other), virus or malware attack, system or human error. Backups are an essential control and safeguard to ensure availability of XPS information being stored, processed or transmitted via information technology communication systems.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Data must be backed up on a regular basis, protected from unauthorised access or modification during storage, and available to be recovered in a timely manner in the event of incident or disaster. See <MadCap:xref href="Data backup.htm">"Data backup" on page&#160;1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.5 &#160;">Change control policy</h3>
        <p>Change Contol  ensures stability and availability of related information technology communication systems. Secure practices including reviews during changes are necessary to ensure service availability.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Any change to XPS production information systems must be logged and assessed for security and risk impact as documented in the XPS Change Canagement process. The requirements, risk and impact of each request must be evaluated and the proposed risk mitigation solution must be documented and approved. See [ ]</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.6 &#160;">Compliance policy</h3>
        <p>Ser</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.7 &#160;">Device management policy</h3>
        <p>Device management is key to prudent security and management practices, providing context for all IT Security Policy statements and Standard requirements. Without an accurate inventory, processes such as vulnerability management are difficult to implement. For example, assessment of in scope devices when responding to critical vulnerabilities, may not be captured, hence devices will remain unpatched and therefore exposed to malicious exploit.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> In the context of this policy, an IT asset is any UNSW owned or managed device or service that connects to or is used by UNSW in its business, research, teaching and learning activities such as data link, physical device, application (including firmware), database and middleware. See [ ]</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.8 &#160;">Encryption policy</h3>
        <p>XPS supports an extensively broad and complex data landscape. Based on appropriate data classification and handling guidelines, this policy and associated standard ensures that appropriate controls are implemented for the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Encryption techniques must be used for protecting sensitive data during transmission and storage. See []</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.9 &#160;">Incident response policy</h3>
        <p>Provides preventive, corrective and detective measures, ensuring a consistent and effective approach to the management of information security incidents, including communication of events and weaknesses, such as breach of access. Well designed, understood tools and processes will help contain, preserve (for legal and forensic purposes) and limit any damage resulting from a security incident.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Incident detection mechanisms such as security event logging and antivirus must be implemented for all IT systems. All potential security incidents must be handled appropriately following a formalised security incident handling process. See []</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.10 &#160;">Information management policy</h3>
        <p>Ser</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.11 &#160;">Logging and monitoring policy</h3>
        <p>Security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection and prevention, security event incident management, mail content filters and anti-virus all generate log data. The timely detection of information security incidents relies on comprehensive security log data being available from information technology communication systems.</p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Statement:</b> Key security-related events such as user privilege changes must be recorded in logs, protected against unauthorised changes and analysed on a regular basis in order to identify potential unauthorised activities and facilitate appropriate follow up action. See [ ]</p>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.6.12 &#160;">Network security policy</h3>
        <p>Network infrastructure and associated data links provide essential connectivity between internal and external systems. In order to provide mitigation against malicious activity, secure boundaries and connections need to be defined and managed in line with current security practises.</p>
        <p class="Example">Statement: UNSW network architecture must commensurate with current and future business requirements as well as with emerging security threats. Appropriate controls must be established to ensure security of UNSW data in private and public networks, and the protection of IT services from unauthorised access. See []</p>
